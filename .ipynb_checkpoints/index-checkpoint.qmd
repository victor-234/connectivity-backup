# Preface
Nothing here, yet.



# Method and Data

## Method
We downloaded 961 annual reports of EURO Stoxx 600 firms from 2018 to 2022.

We then manually classified different sections of the reports:

* MD&A (a.k.a. management report, Lagebericht, etc.)
* Financial Statements and Notes
* Auditor's Report

Finally, we searched for different climate-related keywords:

## Documents

### Sample selection
We distributed the EURO Stoxx 600 firms to student assistants to extract information on the structure of annual reports.
So far, this resulted in the following documents sample: 

1. no metadata in the SRN database yet,
2. after removing not readable pdfs,
3. pdfs where no text was scanned, and 
4. pdfs with too little words(documents where the average clean text characters are less than 1,500 in a document).
